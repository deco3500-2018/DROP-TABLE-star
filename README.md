# Guide to the contents of the repository
This GitHub repository is a central storage space for all code and files of project The True Table by Team Drop Table*. There are two main parts in this repository, Code and Wiki.

The Code section contains all code files and images that were used for building the final interactive prototype. All images of the design process of the project are also included in the code section under Design process folder.

The Wiki part contains the project concept proposal, user testing evaluations, and final documentation. The conference poster and promotional material for the project showcase can also be found in the Wiki.

# Project Overview & Phases
<h2>Overview</h2>
The project addresses the theme of ‘Fake News’ and interprets it in the context of social-media. The Truth Table (TTT) is a social platform that aims to solve the issue of increasing ‘Fake News’ produced by mainstream media, with the intent of manipulation and spreading of biased opinions. The Truth Table connects people to interact and discuss about the current news topics and related articles by sharing opinions and judging the reliability of sources. The aim of The Truth Table is to provide a platform for such users to work together and find the ‘Truth’, through mutual discussion and voting systems. Whether it’s political events, technology news, science questions, or issues happening all around the globe, TTT will have the topic right there, ready for people to find the truth.

The target audience for this project was chosen to be people looking for reliable news source on Social Media, in particular younger people who prefer to use electrical devices for adapting new information compared to the physical resources including newspapers and magazines. There are many people who find it difficult to distinguish the truth of the content provided by media, and interviews have suggested this occurs among the majority of participants. The rationale behind TTT is to alleviate these situations by establishing  connections between people in a shared platform, allowing social connections to form, and providing systems that enable people to think and discuss about the credibility of those news articles.

The original project proposal for The Truth Table can be read [here](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/DROP-TABLE-star/wiki/Proposal).

<h2>Phases</h2>
The project was undertaken in four distinct stages.
The first stage was about researching and establishing ideas. Research was conducted by James, and required investigating similar applications, as well as social concepts. Then, requirements gathering was conducted by going through the existing solutions and identifying what these solutions missed in terms of social interaction and problem solving.  

The design phase was undertaken after requirements collection, and was based on iterative development processes, and rapid prototyping. Design began with digital prototyping, which was then followed by contextual interviews and observing people’s interactions with the prototype. Design was undertaken by Elliot, who created wireframes and front-end design layouts.

As versions of designs were created and updated, user testing sessions were conducted by Ivan, focusing on the usability of prototype and its interaction with users. At the same time, James conducted News testing, which focuses on the presentation of news and how to optimise it based on different audiences.

Once testing had been completed, the team analysed and evaluated the collected user data. The team identified the trends and what needed to be improved and Elliot redesigned the prototype based on the set of required changes.
Based on the final design, Ivan and Vince developed functional features for the final prototype, including key components of the website such as the implementation of commenting and the 'Real or Fake' mini-game.
